# work-day-scheduler

## Description
I created a work day scheduler. With this website you can enter your entire work day schedule and it will save your entries to your local storage meaning that when you come back to the session it will have saved and be displaying your previous entries. It will also show you the current date and time of day down to the second. It is program to show you different colors based on the time of day so if the hour is earlier than the current time it will show the entry blocks as gray, if later than the current time it will show the blocks as green, and it will show the current time as red.
